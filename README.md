## Introduction

This module is based on [@Nols1000](https://github.com/Nols1000)'s [original version](https://github.com/Nols1000/hltv-scorebot), created back in May of 2015. It is packed full of features, but was never updated to the newest version of HLTV's scorebot. The purpose of this version is to be more of a wrapper for HLTV, and to incorporate all of the features available with the new scorebot.

## Getting started

**Install with npm:**
```bash
npm install andrewda/hltv-livescore
```

**Using HLTV Livescore:**
```javascript
var Livescore = require('hltv-livescore');
var ls = new Livescore();
ls.connect(383564, 2299033);

ls.on('kill', function(data) {
    console.log(data.killer.name, 'killed', data.victim.name, 'with', data.weapon, data.headshot ? '(headshot)' : '');
});
```

## Methods

- `connect(matchid, listid, url [optional], port [optional], oldtime [optional])`
    - `matchid` identifier for the wanted match. [andrewda](https://github.com/andrewda) made a module to get the matchid <https://github.com/andrewda/hltv-live-games>
    - `listid` secondary identifier for the wanted match. It can be found in the URL immediatly after `/match/` or on the HLTV page when the game goes live.
       - The list id for http://www.hltv.org/match/2298994-maxandrelax-arcade-dngit-2000-weekly-cup-24 would be 2298994.
    - `url` [OPTIONAL] the ip of the scorebot server (default `http://scorebot2.hltv.org`).
    - `port` [OPTIONAL] the port of the scorebot server (default `10022`).
    - `oldtime` [OPTIONAL] if we want to use the old match time (default `false`)
- `getPlayers()`
    - returns all players connected
- `getTeams()`
    - returns both teams connected
- `on(event, callback)`
